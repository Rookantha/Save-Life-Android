<h3>Abstract.</h3>
<p>Usually, according to the principles and policies of the medical professionals, the diagnostic procedure needs to analyze diagnostic reports like full blood, etc. And needs to read several kinds of scan reports, etc... (Initial Diagnostic Assessment and Diagnostic Testing). Today, most fields of healthcare have faced a lack of efficiency issues because there is no proper communication link in medical laboratories and medical professionals to analytics medical problems and diagnosis according to investigation reports. Also need to improve the procedure of predict risks for illnesses and epidemics, take pro-active and precaution, investigate the nature of the illness, make decisions and sickness collaboration, efficient investigation procedure and develop exciting new techniques to treat diseases.<p>
<p>The aim of this mobile application is how to analyze patients' Diagnostic Reports and visualize patients' information in a proper way using Machine Learning text recognition, optical character recognition, Real-Time Data Manipulation, and text analytics techniques. The application is Integrated by the firebase database Authentication security policy and it will control data access. Text recognition and the text extraction process will be implemented by using Firebase Machine learning Kitâ€™s text recognition APIs with High accuracy. The mobile application allows extract data from the investigation reports and inserts data into the firebase real-time database. Using the Firebase queries and filtering applications will automatically categorize data in who needs emergency treatment as priority wise.<p>
<p>Also, medical experts can monitor patients' updated investigations in real-time. Medical professionals can attend final investigations or required actions immediately Based on real-time updated data. 
Specifications of the specific medical area, medical professionals' communication capabilities, efficient real-time data manipulation, and healthcare prediction capabilities provide a platform for a new generation of Quality essential diagnostics and treatment options.<p>
